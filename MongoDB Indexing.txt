~ Indexes improve MongoDB query execution/performance , much more faster than other querying.
~ Queries are used in find, remove, aggregate etc.
~ without index whole collection must be scanned (COLLSCAN)
~ Index stores sorted field values
~ if appropiate index exists,MongoDB performs only in index scan(IXSCAN)

Index Creation Process
~When index is create, it is created by key and key contains key-value pair, where key is a field name
and value is sort order , where 1 for ascending and -1 for descending. ie key : {age:1} and each key 
points to its corresponding document.

Index Creation Options
~ create index in the background. Other operations will not be blocked.
{background:true} if any quering on collection is going on, this option will not interput the ongoing query operations

~create unique index
{unique:true} this will create unique indexes across collections

~Specify name for the index
{name:"<indexName>"}

db.collection_name.createIndex({index:1},{unique:true})
db.collection_name.getIndexes()

Analyze query performance
~Returns information about the query
db.collection_name.explain().<method>
db.collection_name.explain("executionStats").<method>

db.collection_name.explain().find({"age":{$gt:25})
db.collection_name.explain().aggregate([{$group:{_id:"$country"}}])
