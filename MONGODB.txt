MongoDB Atlas is a cloud-based NoSQL database service developed by MongoDB Inc. It was developed to offer 
a flexible, scalable, and on-demand platform to eliminate the need for costly infrastructure,
 configurations, and maintenance.

Replica Sets
A MongoDB replica set is a group of one or more servers containing the exact copy of the data. 
While it’s technically possible to have one or two nodes, the recommended minimum is three. 
A primary node is responsible for providing your application’s read and write operations, 
while two secondary nodes contain a replica of the data.


There are two different distributed configurations of MongoDB. The first is a “replica set”, 
where several servers carry the exact same data, to protect against failure. 
The second is a “sharded cluster”, where several servers each carry only a fragment of the whole data, 
to achieve higher performance and carry larger data sets


JSON 
- mongoimport
- mongoexport   --uri "<Atlas Cluster URI>"  exports data in JSON

BSON
- mongorestore
- mongodump     --uri "<Atlas Cluster URI>"  exports data in BSON

mongodump --uri "mongodb+srv://<your username>:<your password>@<your cluster>.mongodb.net/sample_supplies"

mongoexport --uri="mongodb+srv://<your username>:<your password>@<your cluster>.mongodb.net/sample_supplies" --collection=sales --out=sales.json
